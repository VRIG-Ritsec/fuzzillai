Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Notes 4 Example 5 See also [ edit ] Parameters arg - pointer to a std::time_t object to store the time, or a null pointer [ edit ] Return value Current calendar time encoded as std::time_t object on success, ( std:: time_t ) ( - 1 ) on error. If arg is not null, the return value is also stored in the object pointed to by arg . [ edit ] Notes The encoding of calendar time in std::time_t is unspecified, but most systems conform to the POSIX specification and return a value of integral type holding 86400 times the number of calendar days since the Epoch plus the number of seconds that have passed since the last midnight UTC. Most notably, POSIX time does not (and can not) take leap seconds into account, so that this integral value is not equal to the number of S.I. seconds that have passed since the epoch, but rather is reduced with the number of leap seconds that have occurred since the epoch. Implementations in which std::time_t is a 32-bit signed integer (many historical implementations) fail in the year 2038 . [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <ctime> #include <iostream> int main ( ) { std:: time_t result = std :: time ( nullptr ) ; std:: cout << std:: asctime ( std:: localtime ( & result ) ) << result << " seconds since the Epoch \n " ; } Possible output: Wed Sep 21 10:27:52 2011 1316615272 seconds since the Epoch [ edit ] See also timespec_get (C++17) returns the calendar time in seconds and nanoseconds based on a given time base (function) [edit] localtime converts time since epoch to calendar time expressed as local time (function) [edit] gmtime converts time since epoch to calendar time expressed as Universal Coordinated Time (function) [edit] system_clock (C++11) wall clock time from the system-wide realtime clock (class) [edit] C documentation for time Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/chrono/c/time&oldid=180262 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский Türkçe 中文 This page was last modified on 7 February 2025, at 21:42.
