[ edit ] Semantic requirements A relation r is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive: for all x , r(x, x) is true ; it is symmetric: for all a and b , r(a, b) is true if and only if r(b, a) is true ; it is transitive: r(a, b) && r(b, c) implies r(a, c) . [ edit ] Notes The distinction between relation and equivalence_relation is purely semantic.
