It is satisfied by types that behave similarly to built-in types like int , and that are comparable with == . [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <concepts> #include <iostream> template < std :: regular T > struct Single { T value ; friend bool operator == ( const Single & , const Single & ) = default ; } ; int main ( ) { Single < int > myInt1 { 4 } ; Single < int > myInt2 ; myInt2 = myInt1 ; if ( myInt1 == myInt2 ) std:: cout << "Equal \n " ; std:: cout << myInt1. value << ' ' << myInt2. value << ' \n ' ; } Output: Equal 4 4 [ edit ] References C++23 standard (ISO/IEC 14882:2024): 18.6 Object concepts [concepts.object] C++20 standard (ISO/IEC 14882:2020): 18.6 Object concepts [concepts.object] [ edit ] See also semiregular (C++20) specifies that an object of a type can be copied, moved, swapped, and default constructed (concept) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/concepts/regular&oldid=177897 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español 日本語 Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 24 November 2024, at 14:36.
