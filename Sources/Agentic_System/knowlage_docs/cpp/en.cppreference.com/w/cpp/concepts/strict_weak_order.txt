Contents 1 Semantic requirements 2 Notes 3 References 4 See also [ edit ] Semantic requirements A relation r is a strict weak ordering if it is irreflexive: for all x , r ( x, x ) is false ; it is transitive: for all a , b and c , if r ( a, b ) and r ( b, c ) are both true then r ( a, c ) is true ; let e ( a, b ) be ! r ( a, b ) && ! r ( b, a ) , then e is transitive: e ( a, b ) && e ( b, c ) implies e ( a, c ) . Under these conditions, it can be shown that e is an equivalence relation, and r induces a strict total ordering on the equivalence classes determined by e . [ edit ] Notes The distinction between relation and strict_weak_order is purely semantic.
