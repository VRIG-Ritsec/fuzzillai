It can be used to report arithmetic overflow errors (that is, situations where a result of a computation is too large for the destination type). The only standard library component that throws this exception is std::bitset::to_ulong . (until C++11) The only standard library components that throw this exception are std::bitset::to_ulong and std::bitset::to_ullong . (since C++11) The mathematical functions of the standard library components do not throw this exception (mathematical functions report overflow errors as specified in math_errhandling ). Third-party libraries, however, use this. For example, boost.math throws std::overflow_error if boost::math::policies::throw_on_error is enabled (the default setting). All member functions of std::overflow_error are constexpr : it is possible to create and use std::overflow_error objects in the evaluation of a constant expression. However, std::overflow_error objects generally cannot be constexpr , because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression.

After construction, std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , what_arg. c_str ( ) ) == 0 . 2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , what_arg ) == 0 . 3) Copy constructor. If * this and other both have dynamic type std::overflow_error then std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , other. what ( ) ) == 0 . No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor. Parameters what_arg - explanatory string other - another exception object to copy Exceptions 1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc . Notes Because copying std::overflow_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&& : it would have to copy the content anyway. Before the resolution of LWG issue 254 , the non-copy constructor can only accept std::string . It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a std::string object. After the resolution of LWG issue 471 , a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object. std::overflow_error:: operator= overflow_error & operator = ( const overflow_error & other ) ; (noexcept since C++11) (constexpr since C++26) Assigns the contents with those of other . If * this and other both have dynamic type std::overflow_error then std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , other. what ( ) ) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator. Parameters other - another exception object to assign with Return value * this Notes After the resolution of LWG issue 471 , a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.
