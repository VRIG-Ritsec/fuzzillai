It can be used to report range errors (that is, situations where a result of a computation cannot be represented by the destination type). The only standard library components that throw this exception are std::wstring_convert::from_bytes and std::wstring_convert::to_bytes . The mathematical functions in the standard library components do not throw this exception (mathematical functions report range errors as specified in math_errhandling ). All member functions of std::range_error are constexpr : it is possible to create and use std::range_error objects in the evaluation of a constant expression. However, std::range_error objects generally cannot be constexpr , because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression.

After construction, std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , what_arg. c_str ( ) ) == 0 . 2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , what_arg ) == 0 . 3) Copy constructor. If * this and other both have dynamic type std::range_error then std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , other. what ( ) ) == 0 . No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor. Parameters what_arg - explanatory string other - another exception object to copy Exceptions 1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc . Notes Because copying std::range_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&& : it would have to copy the content anyway. Before the resolution of LWG issue 254 , the non-copy constructor can only accept std::string . It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a std::string object. After the resolution of LWG issue 471 , a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object. std::range_error:: operator= range_error & operator = ( const range_error & other ) ; (noexcept since C++11) (constexpr since C++26) Assigns the contents with those of other . If * this and other both have dynamic type std::range_error then std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , other. what ( ) ) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator. Parameters other - another exception object to assign with Return value * this Notes After the resolution of LWG issue 471 , a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.
