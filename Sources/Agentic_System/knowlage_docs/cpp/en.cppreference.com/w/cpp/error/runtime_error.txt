It reports errors that are due to events beyond the scope of the program and cannot be easily predicted. All member functions of std::runtime_error are constexpr : it is possible to create and use std::runtime_error objects in the evaluation of a constant expression. However, std::runtime_error objects generally cannot be constexpr , because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression. (since C++26) Inheritance diagram Exceptions of type std::runtime_error are thrown by the following standard library components: std::locale::locale std::locale::combine std:: chrono :: current_zone std:: chrono :: get_tzdb_list std:: chrono :: get_tzdb std:: chrono :: locate_zone std:: chrono :: reload_tzdb std:: chrono :: remote_version std:: chrono :: tzdb :: locate_zone (since C++20) In addition, the following standard exception types are derived from std::runtime_error : std::range_error std::overflow_error std::underflow_error std::ios_base::failure std::regex_error std::system_error (since C++11) std::filesystem::filesystem_error (since C++17) std:: chrono :: ambiguous_local_time std:: chrono :: nonexistent_local_time std:: format_error (since C++20) Contents 1 Member functions 2 std::runtime_error:: runtime_error 2.1 Parameters 2.2 Exceptions 2.3 Notes 3 std::runtime_error:: operator= 3.1 Parameters 3.2 Return value 3.3 Notes 4 Inherited from std:: exception 4.1 Member functions 4.2 Notes 4.3 Defect reports [ edit ] Member functions (constructor) constructs a new runtime_error object with the given message (public member function) operator= replaces the runtime_error object (public member function) std::runtime_error:: runtime_error runtime_error ( const std:: string & what_arg ) ; (1) (constexpr since C++26) runtime_error ( const char * what_arg ) ; (2) (constexpr since C++26) runtime_error ( const runtime_error & other ) ; (3) (noexcept since C++11) (constexpr since C++26) 1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , what_arg. c_str ( ) ) == 0 . 2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , what_arg ) == 0 . 3) Copy constructor. If * this and other both have dynamic type std::runtime_error then std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , other. what ( ) ) == 0 . No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor. Parameters what_arg - explanatory string other - another exception object to copy Exceptions 1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc . Notes Because copying std::runtime_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&& : it would have to copy the content anyway. Before the resolution of LWG issue 254 , the non-copy constructor can only accept std::string . It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a std::string object. After the resolution of LWG issue 471 , a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object. std::runtime_error:: operator= runtime_error & operator = ( const runtime_error & other ) ; (noexcept since C++11) (constexpr since C++26) Assigns the contents with those of other . If * this and other both have dynamic type std::runtime_error then std:: strcmp ( what ( ) , other. what ( ) ) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator. Parameters other - another exception object to assign with Return value * this Notes After the resolution of LWG issue 471 , a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.
