Let e be a subexpression represented by an input error which will be injected and returned by the receiver. The expression just_error ( e ) is expression-equivalent to /*make-sender*/ ( just_error, /*product-type*/ ( e ) ) Customization point objects The name execution::just_error denotes a customization point object , which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. The cv-unqualified version of its type is a tag type denoted as execution::just_error_t . See CustomizationPointObject for details. [ edit ] Notes If the provided error is an lvalue reference, a copy is made inside the returned sender and a non-const lvalue reference to the copy is sent to the receiver’s set_error . If the provided value is an rvalue reference, it is moved into the returned sender and an rvalue reference to it is sent to the receiver’s set_error .
