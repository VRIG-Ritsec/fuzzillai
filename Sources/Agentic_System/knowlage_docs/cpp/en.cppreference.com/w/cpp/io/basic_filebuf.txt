Both the input sequence and the output sequence are associated with the same file, and a joint file position is maintained for both operations. The restrictions on reading and writing a sequence with std::basic_filebuf are the same as std::FILE s. The functions underflow() and overflow() / sync() perform the actual I/O between the file and the get and put areas of the buffer. When CharT is not char , most implementations store multibyte characters in the file and a std::codecvt facet is used to perform wide/multibyte character conversion. Several typedefs for common character types are provided: Defined in header <fstream> Type Definition std::filebuf std :: basic_filebuf < char > std::wfilebuf std :: basic_filebuf < wchar_t > Contents 1 Member types 2 Member functions 3 Public member functions 4 Protected member functions 5 Non-member functions 6 Inherited from std:: basic_streambuf 6.1 Member types 6.2 Member functions 6.2.1 Locales 6.2.2 Positioning 6.2.3 Get area 6.2.4 Put area 6.2.5 Putback 6.3 Protected member functions 6.3.1 Locales 6.3.2 Positioning 6.3.3 Get area 6.3.4 Put area 6.3.5 Putback 6.4 Notes 6.5 See also [ edit ] Member types Type Definition char_type CharT [edit] traits_type Traits ; the program is ill-formed if Traits::char_type is not CharT .
