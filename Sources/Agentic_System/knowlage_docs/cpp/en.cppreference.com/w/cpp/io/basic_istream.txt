The supported operations include formatted input (e.g. integer values or whitespace-separated characters and characters strings) and unformatted input (e.g. raw characters and character arrays). This functionality is implemented in terms of the interface provided by the underlying basic_streambuf class, accessed through the basic_ios base class. The only non-inherited data member of basic_istream , in most implementations, is the value returned by basic_istream::gcount() .
