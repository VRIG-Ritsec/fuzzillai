It effectively stores an instance of std::basic_string and performs output operations to it. At the low level, the class essentially wraps a raw string device implementation of std::basic_stringbuf into a higher-level interface of std::basic_ostream . The complete interface to unique std::basic_stringbuf members is provided.
