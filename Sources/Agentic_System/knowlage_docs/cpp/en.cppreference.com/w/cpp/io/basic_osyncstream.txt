It provides a mechanism to synchronize threads writing to the same stream. It can be used with a named variable: { std :: osyncstream synced_out ( std:: cout ) ; // synchronized wrapper for std::cout synced_out << "Hello, " ; synced_out << "World!" ; synced_out << std:: endl ; // flush is noted, but not yet performed synced_out << "and more! \n " ; } // characters are transferred and std::cout is flushed as well as with a temporary: std :: osyncstream ( std:: cout ) << "Hello, " << "World!" << ' \n ' ; It provides the guarantee that all output made to the same final destination buffer ( std::cout in the examples above) will be free of data races and will not be interleaved or garbled in any way, as long as every write to that final destination buffer is made through (possibly different) instances of std::basic_osyncstream . Typical implementation of std::basic_osyncstream holds only one member: the wrapped std::basic_syncbuf .
