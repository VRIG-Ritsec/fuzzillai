[edit] [ edit ] Notes std::basic_spanbuf does not own the underlying buffer. It is the responsibility of programmers to ensure the underlying buffer is in its lifetime when used by a std::basic_spanbuf object. Additional synchronization may be needed if more than one thread operates the same underlying buffer through different std::basic_spanbuf objects.
