Typical implementations of std::basic_stringbuf hold an object of type std::basic_string or equivalent resizable sequence container directly as a data member and use it as both the controlled character sequence (the array where the six pointers of std::basic_streambuf are pointing to) and as the associated character sequence (the source of characters for all input operations and the target for the output). In addition, a typical implementation holds a data member of type std::ios_base::openmode to indicate the I/O mode of the associated stream (input-only, output-only, input/output, at-end, etc). If over-allocation strategy is used by overflow() , an additional high-watermark pointer may be stored to track the last initialized character. (since C++11) Several typedefs for common character types are provided: Defined in header <sstream> Type Definition std::stringbuf std :: basic_stringbuf < char > std::wstringbuf std :: basic_stringbuf < wchar_t > Contents 1 Member types 2 Exposition-only members 3 Public member functions 4 Protected member functions 5 Non-member functions 6 Inherited from std:: basic_streambuf 6.1 Member types 6.2 Member functions 6.2.1 Locales 6.2.2 Positioning 6.2.3 Get area 6.2.4 Put area 6.2.5 Putback 6.3 Protected member functions 6.3.1 Locales 6.3.2 Positioning 6.3.3 Get area 6.3.4 Put area 6.3.5 Putback [ edit ] Member types Member type Definition char_type CharT [edit] traits_type Traits ; the program is ill-formed if Traits::char_type is not CharT .
