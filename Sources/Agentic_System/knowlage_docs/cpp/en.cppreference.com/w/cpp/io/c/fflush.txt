For input streams (and for update streams on which the last operation was input), the behavior is undefined. If any data are written to an output device, returning from std::fflush establishes an observable checkpoint . (since C++26) If stream is a null pointer, the flushing operation specified above are performed on all open output streams, including the ones manipulated within library packages or otherwise not directly accessible to the program. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Notes 4 See also [ edit ] Parameters stream - the file stream to write out [ edit ] Return value Returns ​ 0 ​ on success. Otherwise returns EOF and sets the error indicator of the file stream. [ edit ] Notes POSIX extends the specification of fflush by defining its effects on an input stream, as long as that stream represents a file or another seekable device: in that case the POSIX file pointer is repositioned to match the C stream pointer (which effectively undoes any read buffering) and the effects of any std::ungetc or std::ungetwc that weren't yet read back from the stream are discarded. Microsoft also extends the specification of fflush by defining its effects on an input stream: in Visual Studio 2013 and prior, it discarded the input buffer , in Visual Studio 2015 and newer, it has no effect, buffers are retained .
