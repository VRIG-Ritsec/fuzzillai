The file position indicator for the stream is advanced by the number of characters read. If the objects are not TriviallyCopyable , the behavior is undefined. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is indeterminate. If a partial element is read, its value is indeterminate. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Example 4 See also [ edit ] Parameters buffer - pointer to the first object in the array to be read size - size of each object in bytes count - the number of the objects to be read stream - input file stream to read from [ edit ] Return value Number of objects read successfully, which may be less than count if an error or end-of-file condition occurs. If size or count is zero, fread returns zero and performs no other action. fread does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers must use std::feof and std::ferror to determine which occurred. [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <cstddef> #include <cstdio> #include <fstream> #include <iomanip> #include <iostream> #include <vector> int main ( ) { // Prepare file std:: ofstream ( "test.txt" ) << 1 << ' ' << 2 << ' \n ' ; std:: FILE * f = std:: fopen ( "test.txt" , "r" ) ; std:: vector < char > buf ( 4 ) ; // char is trivially copyable const std:: size_t n = std :: fread ( & buf [ 0 ] , sizeof buf [ 0 ] , buf. size ( ) , f ) ; std:: cout << "Read " << n << " object" << ( n > 1 ? "s" : "" ) << ": " << std:: hex << std:: uppercase << std:: setfill ( '0' ) ; for ( char n : buf ) std:: cout << "0x" << std:: setw ( 2 ) << static_cast < short > ( n ) << ' ' ; std:: cout << ' \n ' ; std:: vector < std:: string > buf2 ; // string is not trivially copyable // This would result in undefined behavior: // std::fread(&buf2[0], sizeof buf2[0], buf2.size(), f); } Possible output: Read 4 objects: 0x31 0x20 0x32 0x0A [ edit ] See also scanf fscanf sscanf reads formatted input from stdin , a file stream or a buffer (function) [edit] fgets gets a character string from a file stream (function) [edit] fwrite writes to a file (function) [edit] C documentation for fread Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fread&oldid=160023 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 2 October 2023, at 14:30.
