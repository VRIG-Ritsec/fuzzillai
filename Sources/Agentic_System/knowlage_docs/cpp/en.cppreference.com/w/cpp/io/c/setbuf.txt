If buffer is not null, equivalent to std:: setvbuf ( stream, buffer, _IOFBF , BUFSIZ ) . If buffer is null, equivalent to std:: setvbuf ( stream, nullptr, _IONBF , 0 ) , which turns off buffering. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Notes 4 Example 5 See also [ edit ] Parameters stream - the file stream to set the buffer to buffer - pointer to a buffer for the stream to use. If a null pointer is supplied, the buffering is turned off. If not null, must be able to hold at least BUFSIZ characters [ edit ] Return value (none) [ edit ] Notes If BUFSIZ is not the appropriate buffer size, std::setvbuf can be used to change it. std::setvbuf should also be used to detect errors, since std::setbuf does not indicate success or failure. This function may only be used after stream has been associated with an open file, but before any other operation (other than a failed call to std::setbuf / std::setvbuf ). A common error is setting the buffer of stdin or stdout to an array whose lifetime ends before the program terminates: int main ( ) { char buf [ BUFSIZ ] ; std :: setbuf ( stdin , buf ) ; } // lifetime of buf ends, undefined behavior [ edit ] Example std::setbuf may be used to disable buffering on streams that require immediate output. Run this code #include <chrono> #include <cstdio> #include <thread> int main ( ) { using namespace std :: chrono_literals ; std :: setbuf ( stdout , nullptr ) ; // unbuffered stdout std:: putchar ( 'a' ) ; // appears immediately on unbuffered stream std:: this_thread :: sleep_for ( 1s ) ; std:: putchar ( 'b' ) ; } Output: ab [ edit ] See also setvbuf sets the buffer and its size for a file stream (function) [edit] C documentation for setbuf Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/setbuf&oldid=158993 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 13 September 2023, at 12:35.
