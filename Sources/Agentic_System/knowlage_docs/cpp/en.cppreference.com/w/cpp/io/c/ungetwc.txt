The external device associated with the stream is not modified. Stream repositioning operations std::fseek , std::fsetpos , and std::rewind discard the effects of std::ungetwc . If std::ungetwc is called more than once without an intervening read or repositioning, it may fail (in other words, a pushback buffer of size 1 is guaranteed, but any larger buffer is implementation-defined). If multiple successful std::ungetwc were performed, read operations retrieve the pushed-back wide characters in reverse order of std::ungetwc If ch equals WEOF , the operation fails and the stream is not affected. A successful call to std::ungetwc clears the end of file status flag feof . A successful call to std::ungetwc on a stream (whether text or binary) modifies the stream position indicator in unspecified manner but guarantees that after all pushed-back wide characters are retrieved with a read operation, the stream position indicator is equal to its value before std::ungetwc . [ edit ] Parameters ch - wide character to be put back stream - file stream to put the wide character back to [ edit ] Return value On success ch is returned. On failure WEOF is returned and the given stream remains unchanged.
