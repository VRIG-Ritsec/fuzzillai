The object is required to override the virtual function error_category :: name ( ) to return a pointer to the string "iostream" . It is used to identify error codes provided in the exceptions of type std::ios_base::failure . Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Example 4 Defect reports 5 See also [ edit ] Parameters (none) [ edit ] Return value A reference to the static object of unspecified runtime type, derived from std::error_category . [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <fstream> #include <iostream> int main ( ) { std:: ifstream f ( "doesn't exist" ) ; try { f. exceptions ( f. failbit ) ; } catch ( const std:: ios_base :: failure & e ) { std:: cout << "Caught an ios_base::failure. \n " << "Error code: " << e. code ( ) . value ( ) << " (" << e. code ( ) . message ( ) << ") \n " << "Error category: " << e. code ( ) . category ( ) . name ( ) << ' \n ' ; } } Possible output: Caught an ios_base::failure. Error code: 1 (unspecified iostream_category error) Error category: iostream [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
