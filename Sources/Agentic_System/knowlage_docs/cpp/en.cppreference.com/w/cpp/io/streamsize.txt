It is used as a signed counterpart of std::size_t , similar to the POSIX type ssize_t . [ edit ] Notes Except in the constructors of std::strstreambuf , negative values of std::streamsize are never used. [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <iostream> #include <type_traits> static_assert ( std:: is_signed_v < std :: streamsize > ) ; int main ( ) { std:: cout << sizeof ( std :: streamsize ) << ' \n ' ; } Possible output: 8 [ edit ] See also gcount returns number of characters extracted by last unformatted input operation (public member function of std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits> ) [edit] ignore extracts and discards characters until the given character is found (public member function of std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits> ) [edit] read extracts blocks of characters (public member function of std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits> ) [edit] write inserts blocks of characters (public member function of std::basic_ostream<CharT,Traits> ) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/streamsize&oldid=176675 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 3 October 2024, at 06:33.
