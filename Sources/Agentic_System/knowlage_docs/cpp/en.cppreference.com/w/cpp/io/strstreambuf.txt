Typical implementation of a std::strstreambuf holds four private data members: 1) buffer state, a bitmask type which can represent any combination of the four values "allocated" (destructor will deallocate), "constant" (output not allowed), "dynamic" (output may reallocate), or "frozen" (deallocation and reallocation are not allowed) 2) allocated buffer size (the beginning of the buffer does not need a special data member, it may be stored in the inherited pointer eback() ) 3) pointer to user-provided allocation function 4) pointer to user-provided deallocation function.

The recommended replacement is std::spanbuf (since C++23) .
