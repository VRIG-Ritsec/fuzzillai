Just like std::collate , it can be imbued in std::regex and applied, by means of std::locale::operator() , directly to all standard algorithms that expect a string comparison predicate.

Otherwise, the object is not destroyed. Parameters name - the name of the locale refs - the number of references that link to the facet [edit] std::collate_byname:: ~collate_byname protected : ~collate_byname ( ) ; Destroys the facet.

Within an equivalence class, lowercase characters collate before their uppercase equivalents and locale-specific order may apply to the characters with diacritics. In some locales, groups of characters compare as single collation units . For example, "ch" in Czech follows "h" and precedes "i" , and "dzs" in Hungarian follows "dz" and precedes "g" .
