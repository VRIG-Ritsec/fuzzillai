[ edit ] Member types Type Definition enum part { none, space, symbol, sign, value } ; unscoped enumeration type struct pattern { char field [ 4 ] ; } ; the monetary format type Enumeration constant Definition none whitespace is permitted but not required except in the last position, where whitespace is not permitted space one or more whitespace characters are required symbol the sequence of characters returned by moneypunct :: curr_symbol is required sign the first of the characters returned by moneypunct :: positive_sign or moneypunct :: negative_sign is required value the absolute numeric monetary value is required [ edit ] Notes The monetary format is an array of four char s convertible to std::money_base::part . In that sequence, each of symbol , sign , and value appears exactly once, and either space or none appears in the remaining position. The value none , if present, is not first; the value space , if present, is neither first nor last. The default format, returned by the standard specializations of std::moneypunct is { symbol, sign, none, value } . [ edit ] See also moneypunct defines monetary formatting parameters used by std::money_get and std::money_put (class template) [edit] money_get parses and constructs a monetary value from an input character sequence (class template) [edit] money_put formats a monetary value for output as a character sequence (class template) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/locale/money_base&oldid=176730 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 3 October 2024, at 16:28.
