The I/O manipulator std::put_time uses the std::time_put facet of the I/O stream's locale to generate text representation of an std::tm object. Inheritance diagram If a std::time_put specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and do_put() are not guaranteed as specified. Contents 1 Specializations 2 Nested types 3 Data members 4 Member functions 5 Protected member functions 6 Example 7 See also [ edit ] Specializations The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object ): Defined in header <locale> std :: time_put < char > creates narrow string representations of date and time std :: time_put < wchar_t > creates wide string representations of date and time In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements: CharT is one of char and wchar_t , and OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator .
