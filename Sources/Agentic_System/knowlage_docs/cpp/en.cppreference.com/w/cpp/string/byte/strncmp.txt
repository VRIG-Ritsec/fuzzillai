The comparison is done lexicographically. Characters following the null character are not compared. The sign of the result is the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of characters (both interpreted as unsigned char ) that differ in the arrays being compared. The behavior is undefined when access occurs past the end of either array lhs or rhs . The behavior is undefined when either lhs or rhs is the null pointer. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Notes 4 Example 5 See also [ edit ] Parameters lhs, rhs - pointers to the possibly null-terminated arrays to compare count - maximum number of characters to compare [ edit ] Return value Negative value if lhs appears before rhs in lexicographical order. Zero if lhs and rhs compare equal, or if count is zero. Positive value if lhs appears after rhs in lexicographical order. [ edit ] Notes This function is not locale-sensitive, unlike std::strcoll and std::strxfrm . [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <cstring> #include <iostream> void demo ( const char * lhs, const char * rhs, int sz ) { const int rc = std :: strncmp ( lhs, rhs, sz ) ; if ( rc < 0 ) std:: cout << "First " << sz << " chars of [" << lhs << "] precede [" << rhs << "] \n " ; else if ( rc > 0 ) std:: cout << "First " << sz << " chars of [" << lhs << "] follow [" << rhs << "] \n " ; else std:: cout << "First " << sz << " chars of [" << lhs << "] equal [" << rhs << "] \n " ; } int main ( ) { demo ( "Hello, world!" , "Hello, everybody!" , 13 ) ; demo ( "Hello, everybody!" , "Hello, world!" , 13 ) ; demo ( "Hello, everybody!" , "Hello, world!" , 7 ) ; demo ( "Hello, everybody!" + 12 , "Hello, somebody!" + 11 , 5 ) ; } Output: First 13 chars of [Hello, world!] follow [Hello, everybody!] First 13 chars of [Hello, everybody!] precede [Hello, world!] First 7 chars of [Hello, everybody!] equal [Hello, world!] First 5 chars of [body!] equal [body!] [ edit ] See also strcmp compares two strings (function) [edit] wcsncmp compares a certain amount of characters from two wide strings (function) [edit] memcmp compares two buffers (function) [edit] strcoll compares two strings in accordance to the current locale (function) [edit] C documentation for strncmp Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/string/byte/strncmp&oldid=153458 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Polski Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 15 June 2023, at 16:55.
