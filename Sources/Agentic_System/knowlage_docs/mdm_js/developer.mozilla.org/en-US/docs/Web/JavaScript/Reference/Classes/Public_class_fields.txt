It’s been available across browsers since ⁨September 2022⁩. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback Public fields are writable, enumerable, and configurable properties defined on each class instance or class constructor. In this article Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Syntax js class ClassWithField { instanceField; instanceFieldWithInitializer = "instance field"; static staticField; static staticFieldWithInitializer = "static field"; } There are some additional syntax restrictions: The name of a static property (field or method) cannot be prototype . The name of a class field (static or instance) cannot be constructor . Description This page introduces public instance fields in detail. For public static fields, see static . For private fields, see private elements . For public methods, see method definitions . For public accessors, see getter and setter . Public instance fields exist on every created instance of a class. By declaring a public field, you can ensure the field is always present, and the class definition is more self-documenting. Public instance fields are added to the instance either at construction time in the base class (before the constructor body runs), or just after super() returns in a subclass. Fields without initializers are initialized to undefined . Like properties, field names may be computed. js const PREFIX = "prefix"; class ClassWithField { field; fieldWithInitializer = "instance field"; [`${PREFIX}Field`] = "prefixed field"; } const instance = new ClassWithField(); console.log(Object.hasOwn(instance, "field")); // true console.log(instance.field); // undefined console.log(instance.fieldWithInitializer); // "instance field" console.log(instance.prefixField); // "prefixed field" Computed field names are only evaluated once, at class definition time . This means that each class always has a fixed set of field names, and two instances cannot have different field names via computed names. The this value in the computed expression is the this surrounding the class definition, and referring to the class's name is a ReferenceError because the class is not initialized yet. await and yield work as expected in this expression. js class C { [Math.random()] = 1; } console.log(new C()); console.log(new C()); // Both instances have the same field name In the field initializer, this refers to the class instance under construction, and super refers to the prototype property of the base class, which contains the base class's instance methods, but not its instance fields. js class Base { baseField = "base field"; anotherBaseField = this.baseField; baseMethod() { return "base method output"; } } class Derived extends Base { subField = super.baseMethod(); } const base = new Base(); const sub = new Derived(); console.log(base.anotherBaseField); // "base field" console.log(sub.subField); // "base method output" The field initializer expression is evaluated each time a new instance is created. (Because the this value is different for each instance, the initializer expression can access instance-specific properties.) js class C { obj = {}; } const instance1 = new C(); const instance2 = new C(); console.log(instance1.obj === instance2.obj); // false The expression is evaluated synchronously. You cannot use await or yield in the initializer expression. (Think of the initializer expression as being implicitly wrapped in a function.) Because instance fields of a class are added before the respective constructor runs, you can access the fields' values within the constructor. However, because instance fields of a derived class are defined after super() returns, the base class's constructor does not have access to the derived class's fields. js class Base { constructor() { console.log("Base constructor:", this.field); } } class Derived extends Base { field = 1; constructor() { super(); console.log("Derived constructor:", this.field); this.field = 2; } } const instance = new Derived(); // Base constructor: undefined // Derived constructor: 1 console.log(instance.field); // 2 Fields are added one-by-one. Field initializers can refer to field values above it, but not below it. All instance and static methods are added beforehand and can be accessed, although calling them may not behave as expected if they refer to fields below the one being initialized. js class C { a = 1; b = this.c; c = this.a + 1; d = this.c + 1; } const instance = new C(); console.log(instance.d); // 3 console.log(instance.b); // undefined Note: This is more important with private fields , because accessing a non-initialized private field throws a TypeError , even if the private field is declared below. (If the private field is not declared, it would be an early SyntaxError .) Because class fields are added using the [[DefineOwnProperty]] semantic (which is essentially Object.defineProperty() ), field declarations in derived classes do not invoke setters in the base class. This behavior differs from using this.field = … in the constructor. js class Base { set field(val) { console.log(val); } } class DerivedWithField extends Base { field = 1; } const instance = new DerivedWithField(); // No log class DerivedWithConstructor extends Base { constructor() { super(); this.field = 1; } } const instance2 = new DerivedWithConstructor(); // Logs 1 Note: Before the class fields specification was finalized with the [[DefineOwnProperty]] semantic, most transpilers, including Babel and tsc , transformed class fields to the DerivedWithConstructor form, which has caused subtle bugs after class fields were standardized. Examples Using class fields Class fields cannot depend on arguments of the constructor, so field initializers usually evaluate to the same value for each instance (unless the same expression can evaluate to different values each time, such as Math.random() or object initializers). js class Person { name = nameArg; // nameArg is out of scope of the constructor constructor(nameArg) {} } js class Person { // All instances of Person will have the same name name = "Dragomir"; } However, even declaring an empty class field is beneficial, because it indicates the existence of the field, which allows type checkers as well as human readers to statically analyze the shape of the class. js class Person { name; age; constructor(name, age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } } The code above seems repetitive, but consider the case where this is dynamically mutated: the explicit field declaration makes it clear which fields will definitely be present on the instance. js class Person { name; age; constructor(properties) { Object.assign(this, properties); } } Because initializers are evaluated after the base class has executed, you can access properties created by the base class constructor. js class Person { name; age; constructor(name, age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } } class Professor extends Person { name = `Professor ${this.name}`; } console.log(new Professor("Radev", 54).name); // "Professor Radev" Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # prod-FieldDefinition Browser compatibility Loading… See also Using classes guide Classes Private elements class The semantics of all JS class elements by Shu-yu Guo (2018) Public and private class fields on v8.dev (2018) Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
