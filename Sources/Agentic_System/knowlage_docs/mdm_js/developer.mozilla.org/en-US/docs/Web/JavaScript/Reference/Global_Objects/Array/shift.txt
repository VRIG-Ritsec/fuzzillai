It’s been available across browsers since ⁨July 2015⁩. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The shift() method of Array instances removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array. In this article Try it Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it const array = [1, 2, 3]; const firstElement = array.shift(); console.log(array); // Expected output: Array [2, 3] console.log(firstElement); // Expected output: 1 Syntax js shift() Parameters None. Return value The removed element from the array; undefined if the array is empty. Description The shift() method shifts all values to the left by 1 and decrements the length by 1, resulting in the first element being removed. If the length property is 0, undefined is returned. The pop() method has similar behavior to shift() , but applied to the last element in an array. The shift() method is a mutating method . It changes the length and the content of this . In case you want the value of this to be the same, but return a new array with the first element removed, you can use arr.slice(1) instead. The shift() method is generic . It only expects the this value to have a length property and integer-keyed properties. Although strings are also array-like, this method is not suitable to be applied on them, as strings are immutable. Examples Removing an element from an array The following code displays the myFish array before and after removing its first element. It also displays the removed element: js const myFish = ["angel", "clown", "mandarin", "surgeon"]; console.log("myFish before:", myFish); // myFish before: ['angel', 'clown', 'mandarin', 'surgeon'] const shifted = myFish.shift(); console.log("myFish after:", myFish); // myFish after: ['clown', 'mandarin', 'surgeon'] console.log("Removed this element:", shifted); // Removed this element: angel Using shift() method in while loop The shift() method is often used in condition inside while loop. In the following example every iteration will remove the next element from an array, until it is empty: js const names = ["Andrew", "Tyrone", "Paul", "Maria", "Gayatri"]; while (typeof (i = names.shift()) !== "undefined") { console.log(i); } // Andrew, Tyrone, Paul, Maria, Gayatri Calling shift() on non-array objects The shift() method reads the length property of this . If the normalized length is 0, length is set to 0 again (whereas it may be negative or undefined before). Otherwise, the property at 0 is returned, and the rest of the properties are shifted left by one. The property at length - 1 is deleted , and the length property is decremented by one. js const arrayLike = { length: 3, unrelated: "foo", 2: 4, }; console.log(Array.prototype.shift.call(arrayLike)); // undefined, because it is an empty slot console.log(arrayLike); // { '1': 4, length: 2, unrelated: 'foo' } const plainObj = {}; // There's no length property, so the length is 0 Array.prototype.shift.call(plainObj); console.log(plainObj); // { length: 0 } Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-array.prototype.shift Browser compatibility Loading… See also Indexed collections guide Array Array.prototype.push() Array.prototype.pop() Array.prototype.unshift() Array.prototype.concat() Array.prototype.splice() Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
