It’s been available across browsers since ⁨September 2016⁩. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The ArrayBuffer[Symbol.species] static accessor property returns the constructor used to construct return values from array buffer methods. Warning: The existence of [Symbol.species] allows execution of arbitrary code and may create security vulnerabilities. It also makes certain optimizations much harder. Engine implementers are investigating whether to remove this feature . Avoid relying on it if possible. In this article Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Syntax js ArrayBuffer[Symbol.species] Return value The value of the constructor ( this ) on which get [Symbol.species] was called. The return value is used to construct return values from array buffer methods that create new array buffers. Description The [Symbol.species] accessor property returns the default constructor for ArrayBuffer objects. Subclass constructors may override it to change the constructor assignment. The default implementation is basically: js // Hypothetical underlying implementation for illustration class ArrayBuffer { static get [Symbol.species]() { return this; } } Because of this polymorphic implementation, [Symbol.species] of derived subclasses would also return the constructor itself by default. js class SubArrayBuffer extends ArrayBuffer {} SubArrayBuffer[Symbol.species] === SubArrayBuffer; // true When calling array buffer methods that do not mutate the existing object but return a new array buffer instance (for example, slice() ), the object's constructor[Symbol.species] will be accessed. The returned constructor will be used to construct the return value of the array buffer method. Examples Species in ordinary objects The [Symbol.species] property returns the default constructor function, which is the ArrayBuffer constructor for ArrayBuffer . js ArrayBuffer[Symbol.species]; // function ArrayBuffer() Species in derived objects In an instance of a custom ArrayBuffer subclass, such as MyArrayBuffer , the MyArrayBuffer species is the MyArrayBuffer constructor. However, you might want to overwrite this, in order to return parent ArrayBuffer objects in your derived class methods: js class MyArrayBuffer extends ArrayBuffer { // Overwrite MyArrayBuffer species to the parent ArrayBuffer constructor static get [Symbol.species]() { return ArrayBuffer; } } Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-get-arraybuffer-%symbol.species% Browser compatibility Loading… See also ArrayBuffer Symbol.species Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
