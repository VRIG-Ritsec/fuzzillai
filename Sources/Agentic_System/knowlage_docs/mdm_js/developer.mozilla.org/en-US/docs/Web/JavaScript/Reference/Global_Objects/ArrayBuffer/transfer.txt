This feature might not work in older devices or browsers. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The transfer() method of ArrayBuffer instances creates a new ArrayBuffer with the same byte content as this buffer, then detaches this buffer. In this article Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Syntax js transfer() transfer(newByteLength) Parameters newByteLength Optional The byteLength of the new ArrayBuffer . Defaults to the byteLength of this ArrayBuffer . If newByteLength is smaller than the byteLength of this ArrayBuffer , the "overflowing" bytes are dropped. If newByteLength is larger than the byteLength of this ArrayBuffer , the extra bytes are filled with zeros. If this ArrayBuffer is resizable, newByteLength must not be greater than its maxByteLength . Return value A new ArrayBuffer object. Its contents are initialized to the contents of this ArrayBuffer , and extra bytes, if any, are filled with zeros. The new ArrayBuffer is resizable if and only if this ArrayBuffer is resizable, in which case its maxByteLength is the same as this ArrayBuffer 's. The original ArrayBuffer is detached. Exceptions RangeError Thrown if this ArrayBuffer is resizable and newByteLength is greater than the maxByteLength of this ArrayBuffer . TypeError Thrown if this ArrayBuffer is already detached, or if it can only be detached by designated operations. Currently, only certain web APIs are capable of creating ArrayBuffer objects with designated detaching methods, such as GPUBuffer.getMappedRange() and WebAssembly.Memory.buffer . Description The transfer() method performs the same operation as the structured clone algorithm . It copies the bytes of this ArrayBuffer into a new ArrayBuffer object, then detaches this ArrayBuffer object. See transferring ArrayBuffers for more information. transfer() preserves the resizability of this ArrayBuffer . If you want the new ArrayBuffer to be non-resizable, use transferToFixedLength() instead. There's no way to transfer a buffer that makes a fixed-length buffer become resizable. transfer() is very efficient because implementations may implement this method as a zero-copy move or a realloc — there does not need to be an actual copy of the data. Examples Transferring an ArrayBuffer js // Create an ArrayBuffer and write a few bytes const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8); const view = new Uint8Array(buffer); view[1] = 2; view[7] = 4; // Copy the buffer to the same size const buffer2 = buffer.transfer(); console.log(buffer.detached); // true console.log(buffer2.byteLength); // 8 const view2 = new Uint8Array(buffer2); console.log(view2[1]); // 2 console.log(view2[7]); // 4 // Copy the buffer to a smaller size const buffer3 = buffer2.transfer(4); console.log(buffer3.byteLength); // 4 const view3 = new Uint8Array(buffer3); console.log(view3[1]); // 2 console.log(view3[7]); // undefined // Copy the buffer to a larger size const buffer4 = buffer3.transfer(8); console.log(buffer4.byteLength); // 8 const view4 = new Uint8Array(buffer4); console.log(view4[1]); // 2 console.log(view4[7]); // 0 // Already detached, throws TypeError buffer.transfer(); // TypeError: Cannot perform ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer on a detached ArrayBuffer Transferring a resizable ArrayBuffer js const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8, { maxByteLength: 16 }); const view = new Uint8Array(buffer); view[1] = 2; view[7] = 4; // Copy the buffer to a smaller size const buffer2 = buffer.transfer(4); console.log(buffer2.byteLength); // 4 console.log(buffer2.maxByteLength); // 16 const view2 = new Uint8Array(buffer2); console.log(view2[1]); // 2 console.log(view2[7]); // undefined buffer2.resize(8); console.log(view2[7]); // 0 // Copy the buffer to a larger size within maxByteLength const buffer3 = buffer2.transfer(12); console.log(buffer3.byteLength); // 12 // Copy the buffer to a larger size than maxByteLength buffer3.transfer(20); // RangeError: Invalid array buffer length Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-arraybuffer.prototype.transfer Browser compatibility Loading… See also Polyfill of ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer in core-js es-shims polyfill of ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer ArrayBuffer ArrayBuffer.prototype.detached ArrayBuffer.prototype.transferToFixedLength() Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
