Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The adopt() method of AsyncDisposableStack instances registers a value that doesn't implement the async disposable protocol to the stack by providing a custom disposer function. See DisposableStack.prototype.adopt() for general information about the adopt() method. In this article Syntax Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Syntax js adopt(value, onDispose) Parameters value Any value to be registered to the stack. onDispose A function that will be called when the stack is disposed. The function receives value as its only argument, and it can return a promise which gets awaited. Return value The same value that was passed in. Exceptions TypeError Thrown if onDispose is not a function. ReferenceError Thrown if the stack is already disposed. Examples Using adopt() This function creates a file handle (as a Node.js FileHandle ), that gets closed when the function completes. We suppose that the file handle does not implement the async disposable protocol (in reality it does), so we use adopt() to register it to the stack. Because the handle.close() method returns a promise, we need to use an AsyncDisposableStack so that the disposal gets awaited. js async function readFile(path) { await using disposer = new AsyncDisposableStack(); const handle = disposer.adopt( fs.open(path), async (handle) => await handle.close(), ); const data = await handle.read(); // The handle.close() method is called and awaited here before exiting return data; } Specifications Specification ECMAScript Async Explicit Resource Management # sec-asyncdisposablestack.prototype.adopt Browser compatibility Loading… See also JavaScript resource management AsyncDisposableStack AsyncDisposableStack.prototype.defer() AsyncDisposableStack.prototype.use() Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
