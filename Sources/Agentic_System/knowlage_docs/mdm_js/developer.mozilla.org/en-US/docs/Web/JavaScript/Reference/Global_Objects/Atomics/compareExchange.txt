It’s been available across browsers since ⁨December 2021⁩. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The Atomics.compareExchange() static method exchanges a given replacement value at a given position in the array, if a given expected value equals the old value. It returns the old value at that position whether it was equal to the expected value or not. This atomic operation guarantees that no other write happens until the modified value is written back. In this article Try it Syntax Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it // Create a SharedArrayBuffer with a size in bytes const buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(16); const uint8 = new Uint8Array(buffer); uint8[0] = 5; Atomics.compareExchange(uint8, 0, 5, 2); // Returns 5 console.log(Atomics.load(uint8, 0)); // Expected output: 2 Atomics.compareExchange(uint8, 0, 5, 4); // Returns 2 console.log(Atomics.load(uint8, 0)); // Expected output: 2 Syntax js Atomics.compareExchange(typedArray, index, expectedValue, replacementValue) Parameters typedArray An integer typed array. One of Int8Array , Uint8Array , Int16Array , Uint16Array , Int32Array , Uint32Array , BigInt64Array , or BigUint64Array . index The position in the typedArray to exchange a replacementValue . expectedValue The value to check for equality. replacementValue The number to exchange. Return value The old value at the given position ( typedArray[index] ). If the return value is equal to expectedValue , the exchange was successful; otherwise, the exchange failed. Exceptions TypeError Thrown if typedArray is not one of the allowed integer types. RangeError Thrown if index is out of bounds in the typedArray . Examples Using compareExchange() js const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024); const ta = new Uint8Array(sab); ta[0] = 7; Atomics.compareExchange(ta, 0, 7, 12); // returns 7, the old value Atomics.load(ta, 0); // 12 Checking the return value Compare-and-swap guarantees that the new value is calculated based on up-to-date information; if the value had been updated by another thread in the meantime, the write would fail. Therefore, you should check the return value of compareExchange() to check if it has failed, and retry if necessary. Here is one example of an atomic adder (same functionality as Atomics.add() ), adapted from the linked Wikipedia article: js function add(mem, index, a) { let done = false; while (!done) { const value = Atomics.load(mem, index); done = Atomics.compareExchange(mem, index, value, value + a) === value; } return value + a; } It first reads the value at the given index, then tries to update it with the new value. It keeps retrying until it successfully updates the value.
