In this article Syntax Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Syntax js Atomics.notify(typedArray, index, count) Parameters typedArray An Int32Array or BigInt64Array that views a SharedArrayBuffer . index The position in the typedArray to wake up on. count Optional The number of sleeping agents to notify. Defaults to Infinity . Return value Returns the number of woken up agents, or 0 if typedArray is a view on a non-shared ArrayBuffer . Exceptions TypeError Thrown if typedArray is not an Int32Array or BigInt64Array . RangeError Thrown if index is out of bounds in the typedArray . Examples Using notify Given a shared Int32Array : js const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024); const int32 = new Int32Array(sab); A reading thread is sleeping and waiting on location 0 because the provided value matches what is stored at the provided index . The reading thread will not move on until the writing thread has called Atomics.notify() on position 0 of the provided typedArray . Note that if, after being woken up, the value of location 0 has not been changed by the writing thread, the reading thread will not go back to sleep, but will continue on. js Atomics.wait(int32, 0, 0); console.log(int32[0]); // 123 A writing thread stores a new value and notifies the waiting thread once it has written: js console.log(int32[0]); // 0; Atomics.store(int32, 0, 123); Atomics.notify(int32, 0, 1); Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-atomics.notify Browser compatibility Loading… See also Atomics Atomics.wait() Atomics.waitAsync() Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
