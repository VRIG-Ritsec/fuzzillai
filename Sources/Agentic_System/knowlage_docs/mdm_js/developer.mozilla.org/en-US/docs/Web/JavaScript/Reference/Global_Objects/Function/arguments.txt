Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time. Non-standard: This feature is not standardized. We do not recommend using non-standard features in production, as they have limited browser support, and may change or be removed. However, they can be a suitable alternative in specific cases where no standard option exists. Note: The arguments property of Function objects is deprecated. The recommended way to access the arguments object is to refer to the variable arguments available within functions. The arguments accessor property of Function instances returns the arguments passed to this function. For strict , arrow, async, and generator functions, accessing the arguments property throws a TypeError . In this article Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Description The value of arguments is an array-like object corresponding to the arguments passed to a function. In the case of recursion, i.e., if function f appears several times on the call stack, the value of f.arguments represents the arguments corresponding to the most recent invocation of the function. The value of the arguments property is normally null if there is no outstanding invocation of the function in progress (that is, the function has been called but has not yet returned). Note that the only behavior specified by the ECMAScript specification is that Function.prototype has an initial arguments accessor that unconditionally throws a TypeError for any get or set request (known as a "poison pill accessor"), and that implementations are not allowed to change this semantic for any function except non-strict plain functions. The actual behavior of the arguments property, if it's anything other than throwing an error, is implementation-defined. For example, Chrome defines it as an own data property, while Firefox and Safari extend the initial poison-pill Function.prototype.arguments accessor to specially handle this values that are non-strict functions. js (function f() { if (Object.hasOwn(f, "arguments")) { console.log( "arguments is an own property with descriptor", Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(f, "arguments"), ); } else { console.log( "f doesn't have an own property named arguments. Trying to get f.[[Prototype]].arguments", ); console.log( Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor( Object.getPrototypeOf(f), "arguments", ).get.call(f), ); } })(); // In Chrome: // arguments is an own property with descriptor {value: Arguments(0), writable: false, enumerable: false, configurable: false} // In Firefox: // f doesn't have an own property named arguments. Trying to get f.[[Prototype]].arguments // Arguments { … } Examples Using the arguments property js function f(n) { g(n - 1); } function g(n) { console.log(`before: ${g.arguments[0]}`); if (n > 0) { f(n); } console.log(`after: ${g.arguments[0]}`); } f(2); console.log(`returned: ${g.arguments}`); // Logs: // before: 1 // before: 0 // after: 0 // after: 1 // returned: null Specifications Not part of any standard.
