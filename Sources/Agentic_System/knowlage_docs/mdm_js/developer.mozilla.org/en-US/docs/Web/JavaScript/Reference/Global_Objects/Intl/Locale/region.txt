Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The region accessor property of Intl.Locale instances returns the region of the world (usually a country) associated with this locale. In this article Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Description Region is one of the core attributes of a locale. It allows selection for differences between the same language in, say, different countries. For example, English is spoken in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, but there are differences in spelling and other language conventions between those two countries. Knowing the locale's region helps JavaScript programmers make sure that the content from their sites and applications is correctly displayed when viewed from different areas of the world. The region property's value is set at construction time, either through the part of the locale identifier after script or through the region option of the Intl.Locale() constructor. The latter takes priority if they are both present; and if neither is present, the property has value undefined . The set accessor of region is undefined . You cannot change this property directly. Examples Like other locale subtags, the region can be added to the Intl.Locale object via the locale string, or a configuration object argument to the constructor. Adding a region via the locale string The region, if present, is the third part (if script is present, second part otherwise) of a valid Unicode language identifier string, and can be added to the initial locale identifier string that is passed into the Intl.Locale() constructor. Note that the region is not a required part of a locale identifier. js const locale = new Intl.Locale("en-Latn-US"); console.log(locale.region); // "US" Adding a region via the configuration object argument The Intl.Locale() constructor has an optional configuration object argument. Set the region property of the configuration object to your desired region, and then pass it into the constructor. js const locale = new Intl.Locale("fr-Latn", { region: "FR" }); console.log(locale.region); // "FR" Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Internationalization API Specification # sec-Intl.Locale.prototype.region Browser compatibility Loading… See also Intl.Locale Unicode region chart Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
