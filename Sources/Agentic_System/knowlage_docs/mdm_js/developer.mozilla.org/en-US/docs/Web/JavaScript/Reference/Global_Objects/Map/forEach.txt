It’s been available across browsers since ⁨July 2015⁩. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The forEach() method of Map instances executes a provided function once per each key/value pair in this map, in insertion order. In this article Try it Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it function logMapElements(value, key, map) { console.log(`m[${key}] = ${value}`); } new Map([ ["foo", 3], ["bar", {}], ["baz", undefined], ]).forEach(logMapElements); // Expected output: "m[foo] = 3" // Expected output: "m[bar] = [object Object]" // Expected output: "m[baz] = undefined" Syntax js forEach(callbackFn) forEach(callbackFn, thisArg) Parameters callbackFn A function to execute for each entry in the map. The function is called with the following arguments: value Value of each iteration. key Key of each iteration. map The map being iterated. thisArg Optional A value to use as this when executing callbackFn . Return value None ( undefined ). Description The forEach method executes the provided callback once for each key of the map which actually exist. It is not invoked for keys which have been deleted. However, it is executed for values which are present but have the value undefined . callback is invoked with three arguments : the entry's value the entry's key the Map object being traversed If a thisArg parameter is provided to forEach , it will be passed to callback when invoked, for use as its this value. Otherwise, the value undefined will be passed for use as its this value. The this value ultimately observable by callback is determined according to the usual rules for determining the this seen by a function . Each value is visited once, except in the case when it was deleted and re-added before forEach has finished. callback is not invoked for values deleted before being visited. New values added before forEach has finished will be visited. Examples Printing the contents of a Map object The following code logs a line for each element in an Map object: js function logMapElements(value, key, map) { console.log(`map.get('${key}') = ${value}`); } new Map([ ["foo", 3], ["bar", {}], ["baz", undefined], ]).forEach(logMapElements); // Logs: // "map.get('foo') = 3" // "map.get('bar') = [object Object]" // "map.get('baz') = undefined" Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-map.prototype.foreach Browser compatibility Loading… See also Array.prototype.forEach() Set.prototype.forEach() Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
