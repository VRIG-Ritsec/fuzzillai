That is ùôºùöäùöùùöë.ùöéùö°ùöôùöñùü∑ ( ùö° ) = e x ‚àí 1 \mathtt{\operatorname{Math.expm1}(x)} = \mathrm{e}^x - 1 In this article Try it Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it console.log(Math.expm1(0)); // Expected output: 0 console.log(Math.expm1(1)); // Expected output: 1.718281828459045 console.log(Math.expm1(-1)); // Expected output: -0.6321205588285577 console.log(Math.expm1(2)); // Expected output: 6.38905609893065 Syntax js Math.expm1(x) Parameters x A number. Return value A number representing e x - 1, where e is the base of the natural logarithm . Description For very small values of x , adding 1 can reduce or eliminate precision. The double floats used in JS give you about 15 digits of precision. 1 + 1e-15 = 1.000000000000001, but 1 + 1e-16 = 1.000000000000000 and therefore exactly 1.0 in that arithmetic, because digits past 15 are rounded off. When you calculate e x \mathrm{e}^x , where x is a number very close to 0, you should get an answer very close to 1 + x because: lim x ‚Üí 0 e x ‚àí 1 x = 1 \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\mathrm{e}^x - 1}{x} = 1 . If you calculate Math.exp(1.1111111111e-15) - 1 , you should get an answer close to 1.1111111111e-15 . Instead, due to the highest significant figure in the result of Math.exp being the units digit 1 , the final value ends up being 1.1102230246251565e-15 , with only 3 correct digits. If you calculate Math.expm1(1.1111111111e-15) instead, you will get a much more accurate answer, 1.1111111111000007e-15 , with 11 correct digits of precision. Because expm1() is a static method of Math , you always use it as Math.expm1() , rather than as a method of a Math object you created ( Math is not a constructor).
