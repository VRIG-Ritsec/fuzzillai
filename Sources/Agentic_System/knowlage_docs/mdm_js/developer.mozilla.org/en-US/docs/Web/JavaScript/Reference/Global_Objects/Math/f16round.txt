In this article Try it Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it console.log(Math.f16round(5.5)); // Expected output: 5.5 console.log(Math.f16round(5.05)); // Expected output: 5.05078125 console.log(Math.f16round(5)); // Expected output: 5 console.log(Math.f16round(-5.05)); // Expected output: -5.05078125 Syntax js Math.f16round(doubleFloat) Parameters doubleFloat A number. Return value The nearest 16-bit half precision float representation of doubleFloat . Description Math.f16round is the 16-bit counterpart of Math.fround() . It is intended to smooth some rough edges when interacting with float16 numbers, such as when reading from a Float16Array . Internally, JavaScript continues to treat the number as a 64-bit float, it just performs a "round to even" on the 10th bit of the mantissa, and sets all following mantissa bits to 0 . If the number is outside the range of a 16-bit float, Infinity or -Infinity is returned. Because f16round() is a static method of Math , you always use it as Math.f16round() , rather than as a method of a Math object you created ( Math is not a constructor). Examples Using Math.f16round() The number 1.5 can be precisely represented in the binary numeral system, and is identical in 16-bit and 64-bit: js Math.f16round(1.5); // 1.5 Math.f16round(1.5) === 1.5; // true However, the number 1.337 cannot be precisely represented in the binary numeral system, so it differs in 16-bit and 64-bit: js Math.f16round(1.337); // 1.3369140625 Math.f16round(1.337) === 1.337; // false 100000 is too big for a 16-bit float, so Infinity is returned: js Math.f16round(100000); // Infinity Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-math.f16round Browser compatibility Loading… See also Polyfill of Math.f16round in core-js es-shims polyfill of Math.f16round Math.fround() Math.round() Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
