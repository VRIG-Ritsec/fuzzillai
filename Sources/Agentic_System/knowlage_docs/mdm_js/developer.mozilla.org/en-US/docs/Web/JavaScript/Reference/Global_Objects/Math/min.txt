In this article Try it Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it console.log(Math.min(2, 3, 1)); // Expected output: 1 console.log(Math.min(-2, -3, -1)); // Expected output: -3 const array = [2, 3, 1]; console.log(Math.min(...array)); // Expected output: 1 Syntax js Math.min() Math.min(value1) Math.min(value1, value2) Math.min(value1, value2, /* …, */ valueN) Parameters value1 , …, valueN Zero or more numbers among which the lowest value will be selected and returned. Return value The smallest of the given numbers. Returns NaN if any of the parameters is or is converted into NaN . Returns Infinity if no parameters are provided. Description Because min() is a static method of Math , you always use it as Math.min() , rather than as a method of a Math object you created ( Math is not a constructor). Math.min.length is 2, which weakly signals that it's designed to handle at least two parameters. Examples Using Math.min() This finds the min of x and y and assigns it to z : js const x = 10; const y = -20; const z = Math.min(x, y); // -20 Clipping a value with Math.min() Math.min() is often used to clip a value so that it is always less than or equal to a boundary. For instance, this js let x = f(foo); if (x > boundary) { x = boundary; } may be written as this js const x = Math.min(f(foo), boundary); Math.max() can be used in a similar way to clip a value at the other end.
