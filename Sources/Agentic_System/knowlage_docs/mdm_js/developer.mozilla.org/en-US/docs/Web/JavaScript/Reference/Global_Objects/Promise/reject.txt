Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The Promise.reject() static method returns a Promise object that is rejected with a given reason. In this article Try it Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it function resolved(result) { console.log("Resolved"); } function rejected(result) { console.error(result); } Promise.reject(new Error("fail")).then(resolved, rejected); // Expected output: Error: fail Syntax js Promise.reject(reason) Parameters reason Reason why this Promise rejected. Return value A Promise that is rejected with the given reason. Description The static Promise.reject function returns a Promise that is rejected. For debugging purposes and selective error catching, it is useful to make reason an instanceof Error . Promise.reject() is generic and supports subclassing, which means it can be called on subclasses of Promise , and the result will be a promise of the subclass type. To do so, the subclass's constructor must implement the same signature as the Promise() constructor — accepting a single executor function that can be called with the resolve and reject callbacks as parameters. Promise.reject() is essentially a shorthand for new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(reason)) . Unlike Promise.resolve() , Promise.reject() always wraps reason in a new Promise object, even when reason is already a Promise . Examples Using the static Promise.reject() method js Promise.reject(new Error("fail")).then( () => { // not called }, (error) => { console.error(error); // Stacktrace }, ); Rejecting with a promise Unlike Promise.resolve , the Promise.reject method does not reuse existing Promise instances. It always returns a new Promise instance that wraps reason . js const p = Promise.resolve(1); const rejected = Promise.reject(p); console.log(rejected === p); // false rejected.catch((v) => { console.log(v === p); // true }); Calling reject() on a non-Promise constructor Promise.reject() is a generic method. It can be called on any constructor that implements the same signature as the Promise() constructor. For example, we can call it on a constructor that passes it console.log as reject : js class NotPromise { constructor(executor) { // The "resolve" and "reject" functions behave nothing like the // native promise's, but Promise.reject() calls them in the same way. executor( (value) => console.log("Resolved", value), (reason) => console.log("Rejected", reason), ); } } Promise.reject.call(NotPromise, "foo"); // Logs "Rejected foo" Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-promise.reject Browser compatibility Loading… See also Promise Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
