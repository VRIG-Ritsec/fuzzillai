Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The handler.deleteProperty() method is a trap for the [[Delete]] object internal method , which is used by operations such as the delete operator. In this article Try it Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it const monster = { texture: "scaly", }; const handler = { deleteProperty(target, prop) { if (prop in target) { delete target[prop]; console.log(`property removed: ${prop}`); // Expected output: "property removed: texture" } }, }; console.log(monster.texture); // Expected output: "scaly" const proxy = new Proxy(monster, handler); delete proxy.texture; console.log(monster.texture); // Expected output: undefined Syntax js new Proxy(target, { deleteProperty(target, property) { } }) Parameters The following parameters are passed to the deleteProperty() method. this is bound to the handler. target The target object. property A string or Symbol representing the property name. Return value The deleteProperty() method must return a Boolean indicating whether or not the property has been successfully deleted. Other values are coerced to booleans . Many operations, including the delete operator when in strict mode , throw a TypeError if the [[Delete]] internal method returns false . Description Interceptions This trap can intercept these operations: The delete operator: delete proxy[foo] and delete proxy.foo Reflect.deleteProperty() Or any other operation that invokes the [[Delete]] internal method . Invariants The proxy's [[Delete]] internal method throws a TypeError if the handler definition violates one of the following invariants: A property cannot be reported as deleted, if it exists as a non-configurable own property of the target object. That is, if Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() returns configurable: false for the property on target , then the trap must return a falsy value. A property cannot be reported as deleted, if it exists as an own property of the target object and the target object is non-extensible. That is, if Reflect.isExtensible() returns false on target , and Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() returns a property descriptor for the property on target , then the trap must return a falsy value. Examples Trapping the delete operator The following code traps the delete operator. js const p = new Proxy( {}, { deleteProperty(target, prop) { if (!(prop in target)) { console.log(`property not found: ${prop}`); return false; } delete target[prop]; console.log(`property removed: ${prop}`); return true; }, }, ); p.a = 10; console.log("a" in p); // true const result1 = delete p.a; // "property removed: a" console.log(result1); // true console.log("a" in p); // false const result2 = delete p.a; // "property not found: a" console.log(result2); // false Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-proxy-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots-delete-p Browser compatibility Loading… See also Proxy Proxy() constructor delete Reflect.deleteProperty() Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
