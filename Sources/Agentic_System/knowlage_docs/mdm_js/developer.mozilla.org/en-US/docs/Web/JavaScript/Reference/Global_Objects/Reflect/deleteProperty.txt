Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The Reflect.deleteProperty() static method is like the delete operator, but as a function. It deletes a property from an object. In this article Try it Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it const object = { foo: 42, }; Reflect.deleteProperty(object, "foo"); console.log(object.foo); // Expected output: undefined const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; Reflect.deleteProperty(array, "3"); console.log(array); // Expected output: Array [1, 2, 3, <1 empty slot>, 5] Syntax js Reflect.deleteProperty(target, propertyKey) Parameters target The target object on which to delete the property. propertyKey The name of the property to be deleted. Return value A boolean indicating whether or not the property was successfully deleted. Exceptions TypeError Thrown if target is not an object. Description Reflect.deleteProperty() provides the reflective semantic of the delete operator. That is, Reflect.deleteProperty(target, propertyKey) is semantically equivalent to: js delete target.propertyKey; At the very low level, deleting a property returns a boolean (as is the case with the proxy handler ). Reflect.deleteProperty() directly returns the status, while delete would throw a TypeError in strict mode if the status is false . In non-strict mode, delete and Reflect.deleteProperty() have the same behavior. Reflect.deleteProperty() invokes the [[Delete]] object internal method of target . Examples Using Reflect.deleteProperty() js const obj = { x: 1, y: 2 }; Reflect.deleteProperty(obj, "x"); // true console.log(obj); // { y: 2 } const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; Reflect.deleteProperty(arr, "3"); // true console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, <1 empty slot>, 5] // Returns true if no such property exists Reflect.deleteProperty({}, "foo"); // true // Returns false if a property is unconfigurable Reflect.deleteProperty(Object.freeze({ foo: 1 }), "foo"); // false Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-reflect.deleteproperty Browser compatibility Loading… See also Polyfill of Reflect.deleteProperty in core-js Reflect delete handler.deleteProperty() Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
