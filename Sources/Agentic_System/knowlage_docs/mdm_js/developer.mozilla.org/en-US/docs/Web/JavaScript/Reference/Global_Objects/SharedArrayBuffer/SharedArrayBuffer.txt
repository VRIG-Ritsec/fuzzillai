The SharedArrayBuffer() constructor creates SharedArrayBuffer objects. In this article Try it Syntax Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it // Create a SharedArrayBuffer with a size in bytes const buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(8); console.log(buffer.byteLength); // Expected output: 8 Syntax js new SharedArrayBuffer(length) new SharedArrayBuffer(length, options) Note: SharedArrayBuffer() can only be constructed with new . Attempting to call it without new throws a TypeError . Parameters length The size, in bytes, of the array buffer to create. options Optional An object, which can contain the following properties: maxByteLength Optional The maximum size, in bytes, that the shared array buffer can be resized to. Return value A new SharedArrayBuffer object of the specified size, with its maxByteLength property set to the specified maxByteLength if one was specified. Its contents are initialized to 0. Examples Always use the new operator to create a SharedArrayBuffer SharedArrayBuffer constructors are required to be constructed with a new operator. Calling a SharedArrayBuffer constructor as a function without new will throw a TypeError . js const sab = SharedArrayBuffer(1024); // TypeError: calling a builtin SharedArrayBuffer constructor // without new is forbidden js const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024); Growing a growable SharedArrayBuffer In this example, we create an 8-byte buffer that is growable to a max length of 16 bytes, then grow() it to 12 bytes: js const buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(8, { maxByteLength: 16 }); buffer.grow(12); Note: It is recommended that maxByteLength is set to the smallest value possible for your use case. It should never exceed 1073741824 (1GB), to reduce the risk of out-of-memory errors.
