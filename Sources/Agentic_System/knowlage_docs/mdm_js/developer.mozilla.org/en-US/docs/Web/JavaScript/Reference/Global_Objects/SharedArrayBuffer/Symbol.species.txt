It’s been available across browsers since ⁨December 2021⁩. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The SharedArrayBuffer[Symbol.species] static accessor property returns the constructor used to construct return values from SharedArrayBuffer methods. Warning: The existence of [Symbol.species] allows execution of arbitrary code and may create security vulnerabilities. It also makes certain optimizations much harder. Engine implementers are investigating whether to remove this feature . Avoid relying on it if possible. In this article Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Syntax js SharedArrayBuffer[Symbol.species] Return value The value of the constructor ( this ) on which get [Symbol.species] was called. The return value is used to construct return values from array buffer methods that create new array buffer. Description The [Symbol.species] accessor property returns the default constructor for SharedArrayBuffer objects. Subclass constructors may override it to change the constructor assignment. The default implementation is basically: js // Hypothetical underlying implementation for illustration class SharedArrayBuffer { static get [Symbol.species]() { return this; } } Because of this polymorphic implementation, [Symbol.species] of derived subclasses would also return the constructor itself by default. js class SubArrayBuffer extends SharedArrayBuffer {} SubArrayBuffer[Symbol.species] === SubArrayBuffer; // true When calling array buffer methods that do not mutate the existing array but return a new array buffer instance (for example, slice() ), the array's constructor[Symbol.species] will be accessed. The returned constructor will be used to construct the return value of the array buffer method. Examples Species in ordinary objects The [Symbol.species] property returns the default constructor function, which is the SharedArrayBuffer constructor for SharedArrayBuffer . js SharedArrayBuffer[Symbol.species]; // function SharedArrayBuffer() Species in derived objects In an instance of a custom SharedArrayBuffer subclass, such as MySharedArrayBuffer , the MySharedArrayBuffer species is the MySharedArrayBuffer constructor. However, you might want to overwrite this, in order to return parent SharedArrayBuffer objects in your derived class methods: js class MySharedArrayBuffer extends SharedArrayBuffer { // Overwrite MySharedArrayBuffer species to the parent SharedArrayBuffer constructor static get [Symbol.species]() { return SharedArrayBuffer; } } Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-sharedarraybuffer-%symbol.species% Browser compatibility Loading… See also SharedArrayBuffer Symbol.species Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
