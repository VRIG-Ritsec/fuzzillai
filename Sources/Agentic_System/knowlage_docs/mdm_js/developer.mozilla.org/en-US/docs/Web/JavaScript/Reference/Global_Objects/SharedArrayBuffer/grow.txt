In this article Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Syntax js grow(newLength) Parameters newLength The new length, in bytes, to resize the SharedArrayBuffer to. Return value None ( undefined ). Exceptions TypeError Thrown if the SharedArrayBuffer is not growable. RangeError Thrown if newLength is larger than the maxByteLength of the SharedArrayBuffer or smaller than the byteLength . Description The grow() method grows a SharedArrayBuffer to the size specified by the newLength parameter, provided that the SharedArrayBuffer is growable and the new size is less than or equal to the maxByteLength of the SharedArrayBuffer . New bytes are initialized to 0. Examples Using grow() In this example, we create a 8-byte buffer that is growable to a max length of 16 bytes, then check its growable property, growing it if growable returns true : js const buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(8, { maxByteLength: 16 }); if (buffer.growable) { console.log("SAB is growable!"); buffer.grow(12); } Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-sharedarraybuffer.prototype.grow Browser compatibility Loading… See also SharedArrayBuffer SharedArrayBuffer.prototype.growable SharedArrayBuffer.prototype.maxByteLength Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
