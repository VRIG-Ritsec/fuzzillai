It’s been available across browsers since ⁨July 2015⁩. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The String.fromCharCode() static method returns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units. In this article Try it Syntax Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Try it console.log(String.fromCharCode(189, 43, 190, 61)); // Expected output: "½+¾=" Syntax js String.fromCharCode() String.fromCharCode(num1) String.fromCharCode(num1, num2) String.fromCharCode(num1, num2, /* …, */ numN) Parameters num1 , …, numN A number between 0 and 65535 ( 0xFFFF ) representing a UTF-16 code unit. Numbers greater than 0xFFFF are truncated to the last 16 bits. No validity checks are performed. Return value A string of length N consisting of the N specified UTF-16 code units. Description Because fromCharCode() is a static method of String , you always use it as String.fromCharCode() , rather than as a method of a String value you created. Unicode code points range from 0 to 1114111 ( 0x10FFFF ). charCodeAt() always returns a value that is less than 65536 , because the higher code points are represented by a pair of 16-bit surrogate pseudo-characters. Therefore, in order to produce a full character with value greater than 65535 , it is necessary to provide two code units (as if manipulating a string with two characters). For information on Unicode, see UTF-16 characters, Unicode code points, and grapheme clusters . Because fromCharCode() only works with 16-bit values (same as the \u escape sequence), a surrogate pair is required in order to return a supplementary character. For example, both String.fromCharCode(0xd83c, 0xdf03) and "\ud83c\udf03" return code point U+1F303 "Night with Stars". While there is a mathematical relationship between the supplementary code point value (e.g., 0x1f303 ) and both surrogate values that represent it (e.g., 0xd83c and 0xdf03 ), it does require an extra step to either calculate or look up the surrogate pair values every time a supplementary code point is to be used. For this reason, it's more convenient to use String.fromCodePoint() , which allows for returning supplementary characters based on their actual code point value. For example, String.fromCodePoint(0x1f303) returns code point U+1F303 "Night with Stars". Examples Using fromCharCode() BMP characters, in UTF-16, use a single code unit: js String.fromCharCode(65, 66, 67); // returns "ABC" String.fromCharCode(0x2014); // returns "—" String.fromCharCode(0x12014); // also returns "—"; the digit 1 is truncated and ignored String.fromCharCode(8212); // also returns "—"; 8212 is the decimal form of 0x2014 Supplementary characters, in UTF-16, require two code units (i.e., a surrogate pair): js String.fromCharCode(0xd83c, 0xdf03); // Code Point U+1F303 "Night with String.fromCharCode(55356, 57091); // Stars" === "\uD83C\uDF03" String.fromCharCode(0xd834, 0xdf06, 0x61, 0xd834, 0xdf07); // "\uD834\uDF06a\uD834\uDF07" Specifications Specification ECMAScript® 2026 Language Specification # sec-string.fromcharcode Browser compatibility Loading… See also String.fromCodePoint() String.prototype.charAt() String.prototype.charCodeAt() String.prototype.codePointAt() Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
