The Temporal.Duration() constructor creates Temporal.Duration objects. This constructor allows you to create instances by directly supplying the underlying data. Like all other Temporal classes, you should usually construct Temporal.Duration objects using the Temporal.Duration.from() static method, which can handle a variety of input types. In this article Syntax Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Syntax js new Temporal.Duration() new Temporal.Duration(years) new Temporal.Duration(years, months) new Temporal.Duration(years, months, weeks) new Temporal.Duration(years, months, weeks, days) new Temporal.Duration(years, months, weeks, days, hours) new Temporal.Duration(years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes) new Temporal.Duration(years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds) new Temporal.Duration(years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) new Temporal.Duration(years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds) new Temporal.Duration(years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds) Note: Temporal.Duration() can only be constructed with new . Attempting to call it without new throws a TypeError . Parameters years Optional Number of years, or undefined (which is treated as 0 ). months Optional Number of months, or undefined (which is treated as 0 ). weeks Optional Number of weeks, or undefined (which is treated as 0 ). days Optional Number of days, or undefined (which is treated as 0 ). hours Optional Number of hours, or undefined (which is treated as 0 ). minutes Optional Number of minutes, or undefined (which is treated as 0 ). seconds Optional Number of seconds, or undefined (which is treated as 0 ). milliseconds Optional Number of milliseconds, or undefined (which is treated as 0 ). microseconds Optional Number of microseconds, or undefined (which is treated as 0 ). nanoseconds Optional Number of nanoseconds, or undefined (which is treated as 0 ). Return value A new Temporal.Duration object, possibly unbalanced , with the specified components. Exceptions RangeError Thrown in one of the following cases: Any of the parameters is not an integer (including non-finite values). A calendar unit (years, months, weeks) has an absolute value ≥ 2 32 . The non-calendar part of the duration (days and below), when expressed in seconds, has an absolute value ≥ 2 53 . Examples Using Temporal.Duration() js const d = new Temporal.Duration(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10); console.log(d.toString()); // "P1Y2M3W4DT5H6M7.00800901S" Specifications Specification Temporal # sec-temporal-duration-constructor Browser compatibility Loading… See also Temporal.Duration Temporal.Duration.from() Help improve MDN Was this page helpful to you?
