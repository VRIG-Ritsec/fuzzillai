Faster releases · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Faster releases Published 04 March 2021 In order to ship new features and bug fixes faster to its users, Chrome is speeding up its release cycle . In order to match Chrome’s new release cadence, V8 will also start to tag a major release branch every 4 weeks (instead of the previous 6). Every second major release branch will also be maintained for 8 weeks for embedders who prefer to stay on a less frequent update schedule. To learn more about the motivation and the details, check out the Chromium blog post . This change will start rolling out in Q3 of 2021, tentatively targeting Chrome 94 / V8 v9.4 as the launch milestone. For releases that contain interesting changes in terms of language support or optimizations, we’ll continue publishing blog posts on v8.dev to keep developers and embedders up-to-date.
