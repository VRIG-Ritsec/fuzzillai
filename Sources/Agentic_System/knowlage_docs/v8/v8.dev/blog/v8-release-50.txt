V8 release v5.0 Â· V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research V8 release v5.0 Published 15 March 2016 Â· Tagged with release The first step in the V8 release process is a new branch from the Git master immediately before Chromium branches for a Chrome Beta milestone (roughly every six weeks). Our newest release branch is V8 v5.0 , which will remain in beta until we release a stable build in conjunction with Chrome 50 Stable. Hereâ€™s a highlight of the new developer-facing features in this version of V8. Note: The version number 5.0 does not carry semantic significance or mark a major release (as opposed to a minor release). Improved ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) support # V8 v5.0 contains a number of ES2015 features related to regular expression (regex) matching. RegExp Unicode flag # The RegExp Unicode flag , u , switches on a new Unicode mode for regular expression matching. The Unicode flag treats patterns and regex strings as a series of Unicode codepoints. It also exposes new syntax for Unicode codepoint escapes. / ðŸ˜Š{2} / . test ( 'ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š' ) ; // false / ðŸ˜Š { 2 } / u . test ( 'ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š' ) ; // true / \u { 76 } \u { 38 } / u . test ( 'v8' ) ; // true / \u { 1F60A } / u . test ( 'ðŸ˜Š' ) ; // true The u flag also makes the . atom (also known as the single character matcher) match any Unicode symbol rather than just the characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). const string = 'the ðŸ…› train' ; / the\s.\strain / . test ( string ) ; // false / the\s . \strain / u . test ( string ) ; // true RegExp customization hooks # ES2015 includes hooks for RegExp subclasses to change the semantics of matching. Subclasses can override methods named Symbol.match , Symbol.replace , Symbol.search , and Symbol.split in order to change how RegExp subclasses behave with respect to String.prototype.match and similar methods. Performance improvements in ES2015 and ES5 features # Release 5.0 also brings a few notable performance improvements to already implemented ES2015 and ES5 features. The implementation of rest parameters is 8-10x faster than that of the previous release, making it more efficient to gather large numbers of arguments into a single array after a function call. Object.keys , useful for iterating over an objectâ€™s enumerable properties in the same order returned by for - in , is now approximately 2x faster. V8 API # Please check out our summary of API changes . This document gets regularly updated a few weeks after each major release. Developers with an active V8 checkout can use git checkout -b 5.0 -t branch-heads/5.0 to experiment with the new features in V8 5.0. Alternatively you can subscribe to Chrome's Beta channel and try the new features out yourself soon. Posted by the V8 team.
