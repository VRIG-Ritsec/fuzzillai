Each version is branched from V8’s Git master immediately before a Chrome Beta milestone. Today we’re pleased to announce our newest branch, V8 version 6.7 , which is in beta until its release in coordination with Chrome 67 Stable in several weeks. V8 v6.7 is filled with all sorts of developer-facing goodies. This post provides a preview of some of the highlights in anticipation of the release. JavaScript language features # V8 v6.7 ships with BigInt support enabled by default. BigInts are a new numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. Read our BigInt feature explainer for more info on how BigInts can be used in JavaScript, and check out our write-up with more details about the V8 implementation . Untrusted code mitigations # In V8 v6.7 we’ve landed more mitigations for side-channel vulnerabilities to prevent information leaks to untrusted JavaScript and WebAssembly code. V8 API # Please use git log branch-heads/6.6..branch-heads/6.7 include/v8.h to get a list of the API changes. Developers with an active V8 checkout can use git checkout -b 6.7 -t branch-heads/6.7 to experiment with the new features in V8 v6.7.
