V8 release v9.6 · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research V8 release v9.6 Published 13 October 2021 · Tagged with release Every four weeks, we create a new branch of V8 as part of our release process . Each version is branched from V8’s Git master immediately before a Chrome Beta milestone. Today we’re pleased to announce our newest branch, V8 version 9.6 , which is in beta until its release in coordination with Chrome 96 Stable in several weeks. V8 v9.6 is filled with all sorts of developer-facing goodies. This post provides a preview of some of the highlights in anticipation of the release. WebAssembly # Reference Types # The Reference Types proposal , shipped in V8 v9.6, allows using external references from JavaScript opaquely in WebAssembly modules. The externref (formerly known as anyref ) data type provides a secure way of holding a reference to a JavaScript object and is fully integrated with V8's garbage collector. Few toolchains that already have optional support for reference types are wasm-bindgen for Rust and AssemblyScript . V8 API # Please use git log branch-heads/9.5..branch-heads/9.6 include/v8\*.h to get a list of the API changes. Developers with an active V8 checkout can use git checkout -b 9.6 -t branch-heads/9.6 to experiment with the new features in V8 v9.6. Alternatively you can subscribe to Chrome’s Beta channel and try the new features out yourself soon. Posted by Ingvar Stepanyan ( @RReverser ). Retweet this article!
