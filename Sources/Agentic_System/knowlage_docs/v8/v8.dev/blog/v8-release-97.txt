JavaScript # findLast and findLastIndex array methods # The findLast and findLastIndex methods on Array s and TypedArray s find elements that match a predicate from the end of an array. For example: [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] . findLast ( ( el ) => el % 2 === 0 ) // → 4 (last even element) These methods are available without a flag starting in v9.7.
