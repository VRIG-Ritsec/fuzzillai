i18n support · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research i18n support V8 optionally implements the ECMAScript 402 specification . The API is enabled by default, but can be turned off at compile time. Prerequisites # The i18n implementation adds a dependency on ICU. As of v7.2, V8 requires at least ICU version 63. The exact dependency is specified in V8’s DEPS file . Run the following command to check out a suitable version of ICU into third_party/icu : gclient sync See “staying up to date” for more details. Alternative ICU checkout # You can check out the ICU sources at a different location and define the gyp variable icu_gyp_path to point at the icu.gyp file. System ICU # Last but not least, you can compile V8 against a version of ICU installed in your system. To do so, specify the GYP variable use_system_icu=1 . If you also have want_separate_host_toolset enabled, the bundled ICU is still compiled to generate the V8 snapshot. The system ICU is only used for the target architecture. Embedding V8 # If you embed V8 in your application, but your application itself doesn’t use ICU, you need to initialize ICU before calling into V8 by executing: v8 :: V8 :: InitializeICU ( ) ; It is safe to invoke this method if ICU was not compiled in, then it does nothing. Compiling without i18n support # To build V8 without i18n support, use gn args to set v8_enable_i18n_support = false before compiling.
