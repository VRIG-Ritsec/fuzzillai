Officially supported configurations · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Officially supported configurations V8 supports a multitude of different build configurations across operating systems, their versions, architecture ports, build flags and so on. The rule of thumb: If we support it, we have a bot running on one of our continuous integration consoles . Some nuances: Breakages on the most important builders will block code submission. A tree sheriff will usually revert the culprit. Breakages on roughly the same set of builders block our continuous roll into Chromium. Some architecture ports are handled externally . Some configurations are experimental . Breakages are permitted and will be handled by the owners of the configuration. If you have a configuration that exhibits a problem, but is not covered by one of the bots above: Feel free to submit a CL that fixes your problem. The team will support you with a code review. You can use v8-dev@googlegroups.com to discuss the problem. If you think we should support this configuration (maybe a hole in our test matrix?), please file a bug on the V8 issue tracker and ask. However, we don’t have the bandwidth to support every possible configuration.
