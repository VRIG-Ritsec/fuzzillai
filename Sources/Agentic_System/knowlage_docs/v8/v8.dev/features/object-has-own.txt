Object.hasOwn · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Object.hasOwn Published 01 July 2021 · Tagged with ECMAScript Today, it is very common to write code like this: const hasOwnProperty = Object . prototype . hasOwnProperty ; if ( hasOwnProperty . call ( object , 'foo' ) ) { // `object` has property `foo`. } Or to use libraries that expose a simple version of Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty , such as has or lodash.has . With the Object.hasOwn proposal , we can simply write: if ( Object . hasOwn ( object , 'foo' ) ) { // `object` has property `foo`. } Object.hasOwn is already available in V8 v9.3 behind the --harmony-object-has-own flag, and we’ll be rolling it out in Chrome soon.
