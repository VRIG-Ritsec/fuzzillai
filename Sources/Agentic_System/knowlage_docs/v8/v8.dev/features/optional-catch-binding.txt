Optional catch binding · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Optional catch binding Published 27 March 2018 · Tagged with ECMAScript ES2019 The catch clause of try statements used to require a binding: try { doSomethingThatMightThrow ( ) ; } catch ( exception ) { // ^^^^^^^^^ // We must name the binding, even if we don’t use it! handleException ( ) ; } In ES2019, catch can now be used without a binding . This is useful if you don’t have a need for the exception object in the code that handles the exception. try { doSomethingThatMightThrow ( ) ; } catch { // → No binding! handleException ( ) ; } Optional catch binding support # Chrome: supported since version 66 Firefox: supported since version 58 Safari: supported Node.js: supported since version 10 Babel: supported about this feature support listing Posted by Mathias Bynens ( @mathias ).
