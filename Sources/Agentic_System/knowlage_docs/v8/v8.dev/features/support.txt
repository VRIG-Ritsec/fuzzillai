Feature support · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research JavaScript/Wasm feature support # Our JavaScript and WebAssembly language feature explainers often include feature support listings like the following: Chrome: supported since version 71 Firefox: supported since version 65 Safari: supported since version 12 Node.js: supported since version 12 Babel: supported about this feature support listing A feature without any support would look like this: Chrome: no support Firefox: no support Safari: no support Node.js: no support Babel: no support about this feature support listing For cutting-edge features, it’s common to see mixed support across environments: Chrome: partially supported Firefox: supported Safari: supported Node.js: no support Babel: supported about this feature support listing The goal is to provide a quick overview of a feature’s maturity not just in V8 and Chrome, but across the wider JavaScript ecosystem. Note that this is not limited to native implementations in actively-developed JavaScript VMs such as V8, but also includes tooling support, represented using the Babel icon here. The Babel entry covers various meanings: For syntactic language features such as class fields , it refers to transpilation support. For language features that are new APIs such as Promise.allSettled , it refers to polyfill support. (Babel offers polyfills through the core-js project .) The Chrome logo represents V8, Chromium, and any Chromium-based browsers.
