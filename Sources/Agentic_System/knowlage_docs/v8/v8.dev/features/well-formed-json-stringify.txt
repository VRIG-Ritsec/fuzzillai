Well-formed JSON.stringify · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Well-formed JSON.stringify Published 11 September 2018 · Tagged with ECMAScript ES2019 JSON.stringify was previously specified to return ill-formed Unicode strings if the input contains any lone surrogates: JSON . stringify ( '\uD800' ) ; // → '"�"' The “well-formed JSON.stringify ” proposal changes JSON.stringify so it outputs escape sequences for lone surrogates, making its output valid Unicode (and representable in UTF-8): JSON . stringify ( '\uD800' ) ; // → '"\\ud800"' Note that JSON.parse(stringified) still produces the same results as before. This feature is a small fix that was long overdue in JavaScript. It’s one less thing to worry about as a JavaScript developer. In combination with JSON ⊂ ECMAScript , it enables safely embedding JSON-stringified data as literals into JavaScript programs, and writing the generated code to disk in any Unicode-compatible encoding (e.g. UTF-8). This is super useful for metaprogramming use cases .
