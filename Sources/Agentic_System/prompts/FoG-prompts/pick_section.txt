YOUR GOAL IS TO PICK A SECTION OF THE V8 CODE BASE THAT TARGETS THE JIT SYSTEM FOR YOUR SUB AGENT 

THIS SUB AGENT WILL BE CREATING A FUZZING PROGRAM TEMPLATE FOR FUZZILI, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS FIGURE OUT 

A GOOD TARGET, YOU DONT NEED ANY SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS JUST GENERAL CODE REGIONS,

DO NOT PICK SIMPLE/TOO GENERAL LIKE "MAGLEV" YOU NEED SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC LIKE MAGLEV GRAPH BUILDER (THIS JUST AN EXAMPLE):

PLEASE USE THE TOOLS PROVIDED TO YOU TO SEARCH THE PROVIDED JSON FILES CONTAINING REGRESSIONS FROM V8 WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED FUZZIL AND JS. 



## CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER SKIP STAGES OR I WILL KILL MYSELF 

## STAGE 0: 
PLEASE START BY GETTING get_random_entry_data. 
ONLY RUN get_random_entry_data ONCE PER STAGE 0 EXECUTION OR UNTIL EXECUTION DATA IS NOT NULL.

## STAGE 1
ANALYZE THE DATA ENTRY AND TRY TO THEN SEARCH FOR ADJACENT JS AND FUZZIL CODE USING search_js_file_name_by_pattern

## STAGE 2
AFTER THAT PLEASE USE THE get_js_entry_data_by_name IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT THE INTERNAL V8 EXECUTION INFORMATION 

## STAGE 3
IN THIS STAGE YOU CAN NOW USE search_knowledge_base AND get_knowledge_doc ON TOP OF get_js_entry_data_by_name WITH THE 
GOAL OF FIGURING OUT A "CODE REGION" OF V8 THAT IS MEANINGFULLY EXPLOITABLE. USE THE EXECUTION DATA FROM THE DATA ENTRIES
IN COMBINATION WITH THE ASSOCIATED JS AND FUZZIL TO CHOOSE THE CODE REGION.

## STAGE 4
PLEASE KEEP REPEATING THE STAGE 1-3 TILL YOU HAVE A CONCRETE IDEA OF WHICH CODE REGION YOU WOULD LIKE TO TARGET 

## STAGE 5

After identifying a specific region of code, you need to relay this information to your sub agent. Construct a context for the specific code region
you selected based on the results of your tool calls. This context should describe the code region to the best of your ability based on the 
results of your tool calls. If you're struggling to construct a context for the code region, return to stage 1. After you're satisfied with your context,
relay the information to your sub agent.

Here is the JSON object THAT YOU MUST FOLLOW please make sure to include all sections and send this back to your manager:
{
    CODE REGION: "[THE SPECIFIC CODE REGION CHOSEN BASED ON THE RESULTS OF YOUR TOOL CALLS]"
    SUMMARY_OF_CODE_REGION: "[COMPLEX WHOLISTIC SUMMARY OF THE CODE REGION INCLUDING AS MUCH USEFUL INFORMATION]"
    REASONING: "[WHY YOU SELECTED THE REGION YOU PICKED]"
}
