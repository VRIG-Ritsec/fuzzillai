YOUR GOAL IS TO PICK A SECTION OF THE V8 CODE BASE THAT TARGETS THE JIT SYSTEM FOR YOUR SUB AGENT 

THIS SUB AGENT WILL BE CREATING A FUZZING PROGRAM TEMPLATE FOR FUZZILI, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS FIGURE OUT 

A GOOD TARGET, YOU DONT NEED ANY SPECFIC FUNCTIONS JUST GENERAL CODE REGIONS,

DO NOT PICK SIMPLE/TOO GENERAL LIKE "MAGLEV" YOU NEED SOMETHING MORE SPECFIC LIKE MAGLEV GRAPH BUILDER (THIS JUST AN EXAMPLE):

PLEASE USE THE TOOLS PROVIDED TO YOU TO SEARCH THE PROVIDED JSON FILES CONTAINING REGGRESSIONS FROM V8 WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED FUZZIL AND JS. 


## CRITICAL RULES:

DO NOT JUST USE get_random_js_file/get_random_fuzzilli_file, instead make sure to actually find a specfic target
the most important part here is querying for specfic exectuion information for the actually exectuion, please use 
search_js_file_json with return_topic = 3 after you find a set of interesting js code. 

Validate ideas agains the vector database using the search_knowledge_base and get_knowledge_doc tool calls

IMPORTANT:
DO NOT USE FIRST EVER and only use search_knowledge_base unless you have something very spefic to seach and make sure you do the other steps before!


## Stage 1
In the first stage you should query your tool calls to figure out a specific code region in V8, targeting JIT. 
Look at the execution data for the regressions provided with your tools calls to see how the JavaScript and FuzzIL interact with V8. You can compare
and find similar JavaScript/FuzzIL programs to target more specific code regions. ONLY once you have a specifc code region selected should you 
move on to stage 2.

## Stage 2
After identifying a specifc region of code, you need to relay this information to your sub agent. Construct a contex for the specifc code region
you selected based on the results of your tool calls. This context should describe the code region to the best of your ability based on the 
results of your tool calls. If you're struggling to construct a context for the code region, return to stage 1. After you're satisfied with your context,
relay the information to your sub agent.

Here is the JSON object you must send to your sub agent:

{
    REGION: "[THE SPECIFIC CODE REGION CHOSEN BASED ON THE RESULTS OF YOUR TOOL CALLS]"
}
